//! Serial (concurrency = 1) background task executor.
//!
//! The executor owns a single worker thread that pulls `QueuedJob`s from a FIFO
//! channel and runs them one at a time. Its purpose is to guarantee that
//! Soundgnome only ever runs **one** heavy job at a time, which:
//!
//! - avoids SQLite `database is locked` errors caused by two writers racing
//!   for the exclusive database lock on concurrent playlist syncs,
//! - keeps external API usage (Spotify, SoundCloud, YouTube, MusicBrainz…)
//!   well below rate-limit thresholds by not fanning out,
//! - prevents `yt-dlp` / `ffmpeg` from stepping on each other when the host
//!   has limited CPU or bandwidth.
//!
//! Producers (routes, scheduler, boot recovery) call `enqueue_*` and get back
//! either the assigned `task_id` immediately (for fire-and-forget jobs) or a
//! oneshot receiver that resolves once the job finishes (for the synchronous
//! single-track download path).
//!
//! Task lifecycle in DB:
//! - `Pending` — inserted by the caller, sitting in the queue.
//! - `Running` — set by the worker just before it starts the job.
//! - `Completed` / `Failed` / `Cancelled` — set by the worker when the job
//!   returns.
