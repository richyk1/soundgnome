# Web admin interface

Soundgnome ships a lightweight web admin panel served directly by the Rocket server. It covers the full day-to-day management workflow: submitting downloads, reviewing pending validations, browsing and editing the library, monitoring background tasks, and managing scheduled syncs.

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Backend API | Rocket 0.5 + `rocket_okapi` | `apps/server/src/routes/` |
| Frontend | Svelte 5 + Vite + TypeScript | `apps/web/` |
| Build output | Static files served by Rocket | `data/web/` |

Rocket mounts the compiled SPA at `/` via `FileServer::from("data/web")` and exposes all API endpoints under `/api`.

## Running

```bash
# Development (Rocket + Vite with HMR)
pnpm dev

# Build only the frontend
pnpm web:build
```

## Pages

### Download (Home)

- URL input form accepting Spotify, SoundCloud, YouTube, and YouTube Music links
- Track-versus-playlist detection based on URL patterns
- Inline download result feedback: success banner with track title and artists, or error message
- Tracks flagged `needs_validation` are highlighted with a `review` badge
- Recent-downloads list, refreshed automatically after each submission

### Library

Tabbed view for browsing and editing the entire library.

**Tabs:** Artists · Albums · Tracks · Playlists

**Artists tab**

- List or grid view; toggle with the view buttons in the toolbar
- Search by name (`S` to focus)
- **Similar filter** — highlights artists whose names differ by only a few characters, useful for spotting duplicates
- Click an artist to drill into their albums and tracks
- **Multi-select** (`Shift`+click) to select two or more artists; a floating action bar appears to **merge** them into one

**Albums tab**

- Grid or list view; search by title or artist
- Click an album to see its tracks

**Tracks tab**

- Filterable by status: All / OK / Pending validation
- Search by title or artist
- Edit or delete individual tracks

**Playlists tab**

- Lists all synced playlists
- Click a playlist to see its tracks

**Drill navigation**

- Breadcrumb bar shows the current path (e.g. Artists › Artist name › Album title)
- `Backspace` navigates up one level
- Browser back/forward buttons are supported (hash-based routing)

**Edit modal**

- Available for tracks, albums, and artists
- Supports cover/photo upload by file picker, drag-and-drop, or a direct image URL (albums/artists)
- Albums and artists have a **Fetch from references** button next to the image URL field: it re-queries whichever of the entity's existing references point to a supported provider (Spotify, SoundCloud, YouTube Music) and, on the first match, saves the returned image as the cover/icon. Disabled when there are no references yet; shows an error if none of them resolve to an image.
- **References panel**: add a reference by picking a `ref_type` (Source/Provider/Metadata/Reference) and pasting a link — the platform and external id are inferred automatically from the URL. An **Advanced** disclosure allows overriding the inferred platform or setting an id-only reference (no URL), for platforms whose URLs don't embed a stable id (SoundCloud, Bandcamp).
- `Enter` saves, `Esc` cancels

### Validations

Lists all tracks flagged `needs_validation = true`. These are tracks whose metadata could not be matched with sufficient confidence during the download pipeline.

Each card shows:

- Cover, title, artists, album, genre, date, duration, and track/disc numbers
- `validation_reason` explaining why the track was held back
- Staged file path (the audio file already downloaded to the temp directory)

**Available actions:**

| Action | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Edit** | Open inline metadata form (fields: title, artists, album, genre, date, track #, disc #, label) |
| **Show matches** | Fetch alternative metadata candidates from providers (shown when reason is `metadata_partial_match`) |
| **Select** (on a candidate) | Apply that candidate's metadata directly and approve |
| **Approve** | Apply any edits, tag the staged file, move it to the library, clear the validation flag |
| **Reject** | Delete the track row and its staged file from the database |

**Search:** filter by title, artist, album, or validation reason.

### Tasks

Background job monitor (playlist syncs, downloads).

- Auto-refreshes every 3 seconds
- Each task shows: label, status badge, progress bar (Running/Completed), error message, last update time
- **Retry** available for Pending, Running, Failed, and Cancelled tasks
- **Cancel** available for Running and Pending tasks

### Sync Schedules

Configure playlists to sync automatically at a fixed interval.

- Add a schedule: playlist URL, optional label, interval in minutes
- Per-schedule actions: **Pause / Resume**, **Sync now** (triggers an immediate background task), **Delete**
- Shows last-run and next-run timestamps

## Keyboard shortcuts

### Library

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `S` | Focus the search field |
| `E` | Edit the item under the cursor |
| `Backspace` | Go up one level (album → artist → list) |
| `Shift`+click | Select an artist for merge |
| `M` | Start merge (requires ≥ 2 artists selected) |
| `Esc` | Cancel merge picking / clear selection |

### Validations (TrackCard)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `E` (while hovering a card) | Open inline edit form |
| `Esc` | Close the inline edit form |

### Edit modal

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | Save changes |
| `Esc` | Cancel without saving |

### Global

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `?` | Open / close the help panel |

## Validation workflow

When metadata enrichment returns a partial or no match, the track is saved for manual review. The audio file has already been downloaded to staging at this point, so no re-download is needed on approval.

```
fetch metadata
    ↓
metadata enrichment (MusicBrainz, Bandcamp, Spotify…)
    ↓
download audio → staging (temp_download_dir/)
    ↓
Confident match?
 ├── yes → tag + move to library → done
 └── no  → save to DB with needs_validation=true
                    ↓
            User reviews via Validations page
                    ↓
            (optional) edit metadata or pick a candidate
                    ↓
            Approve → tag staged file + move to library
                   or
            Reject  → delete from DB
```
